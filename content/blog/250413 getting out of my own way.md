When I set up this website, I really wanted to make it a place where I could return to blogging regularly. A low-stakes, comfortable digital home for myself. I think it was relatively easier to do so when it was hosted on micro.blog, which was really made for short-form posts, but I find the mental hurdle a bit higher to jump with 11ty because I keep thinking I need to have something substantial to say with every post (tbf to 11ty, this would also be the case with most other blog platforms).

Truth be told, though, when I think back to my time on micro.blog, I’d often start off intending to dash off a very short post and wind up with something several paragraphs long. It’s not that I have nothing to say. It’s just that when everything is a simmering soup in my head it doesn’t *feel* substantial, but once I start writing, the words flow easily. Blogging has never really felt like work to me once I sit down to do it. Time and again, I’ve seen that if I get out of my own way, I can write a fair bit pretty quickly (and find it fun)!

So this is me, getting out of my own way. In the past month, I’ve:

**Written and sent out my first complete short story in a good year or so.** It feels cathartic and satisfying, regardless of the outcome. I spent most of 2023 and 2024 working on a novel project, so short fiction kinda took a backseat, which meant I did write a bunch of first draft-quality things but I never really committed the time to polish and send out any of them. What I didn’t realise till I sent out this story a few weeks ago was that I’d really missed the feeling of seeing something through to completion. That skill hasn’t been exercised in a while. To see a piece take shape the way you imagined it to be, from the clumsy, awkward first draft to its final form, and deem it good enough to be released into the world—that’s something I haven’t felt from two years of novel writing, and wow, did it feel good. I’m glad I did it.

**Gone on a five-day hike on the Nakasendo Trail.** What an experience. I’ve never done a multi-day hike before. I have simultaneously too much to say about it and also nothing to say at all because… I don’t really know how to put it all in words. I think I would like to blog about it at some point. So for now, suffice it to say that I had an amazing time, that the scenery on the Nakasendo is stunning, and that walking through the mountains of Nagano-ken in inches-thick fresh snowfall at the end of March is one of the most surreal times I’ve ever had.

**Bought a travel backpack to rule them all.** I used my dad’s Cotopaxi Allpa 28l on the Nakasendo hike because I didn’t have a suitable backpack of my own, and I was so impressed by it that I promptly ordered my own once I got home. This is not a paid endorsement of the Allpa, I just found it a really, really good bag. It holds an honestly astounding amount of stuff, was comfortable to carry, opens out flat, *and* fits under an airplane seat if you need it to!

**Attended an SSO concert.** Dvorak Violin Concerto and Elgar’s Enigma Variations! These aren’t pieces I know well, so it was fun to experience some unfamiliar music and spend time with the SSO again. Going to a concert and being reminded of the incomparable frisson of live music always makes me feel that I don’t go often enough.

**Planned my next trip**, a quick weekend getaway to KL to watch a concert in May! I haven’t been to KL in over twenty years and to be honest I wouldn’t choose to go there usually (I prefer to take holidays in very walkable cities) so I look forward to seeing how it’s changed.

I’ve also been slowly catching up with life after returning from Japan: family, friends, work, exercise, cooking, cleaning, assorted post-travel admin. I usually keep a handwritten trip journal when I travel, which I then type up in my notes when I get home. This time round I was so tired after each day’s hike that I decided not to, which meant I wrote up my trip journal from memory, and that took a while. Today was the first day I’ve really had all to myself at home since I got back, so I finally finished it. (I am also constantly, consciously reminding myself that journalling and writing up a blog post like this are creative activities as much as working on a short story, and practising letting go of the pressure to do fiction writing every day when I’ve been busy, tired, and running on fumes.)
