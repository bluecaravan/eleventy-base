- I took part in a panel reading and talk for [Best New Singaporean Short Stories Vol 6][1] at Kino, which was super fun and just a great way to start the year. Really thankful to Jason at Epigram Books for the opportunity :)
- Working on revising the novel draft I spent last year writing, where ‚Äúrevising‚Äù is a word that here means ‚Äúwriting it all over again‚Äù, this time with some semblance of actual plan (in the form of a very sprawling mindmap).
- üìö  Reading: I finished *[Welcome to the Hyunam-Dong Bookshop][2]* and *[The Kamogawa Book Detectives][3]* this month, both of which sit squarely in the category I loosely think of as ‚Äúcosy healing fiction‚Äù. There has been a particular groundswell of this genre in Japanese and Korean fiction, which I can‚Äôt help but feel is a sign of how much stories like these resonate with people now.
- üéµ Listened to the masterful Garrick Ohlsson and the SSO play Rach 2 piano concerto, my favourite classical piece ever, always a treat.
- Would like to blog more consistently this year‚Äîand get over the idea that I need to write Proper Blog Entries because really this is my space to livetweet whatever is in my head.
