There was so much I wanted to attend at this year’s Singapore Writers Festival but I was flattened by a violent cough for most of it, so I only managed to get myself to one panel on the etymology of punk. Happily it was the one I was most excited about because I love love love Arkady Martine’s Teixcalaan novels and I was so excited to get to see her in person.

It was a super interesting panel on —-punk genres (steampunk, cyberpunk, silkpunk, the like) and great discussion about the history of punk, its quintessential elements of technology, transhumanism and anti-establishmentarianism, and the tensions that arise with formalism and historical context when engaging with punk genres. I’ve always loved steampunk and its variants and wanted to someday work in it. This panel gave me a lot to chew on and think about, for whenever that someday comes.
