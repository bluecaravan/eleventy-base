This story I read today about [Texas death row inmates playing D&D](https://www.themarshallproject.org/2023/08/31/dungeons-and-dragons-texas-death-row-tdcj) really got me. I can’t tell you exactly why—something about how young and immature many of these men were when they committed a crime that would send them to death, something about the wonder of D&D, the way it allows you to rewrite your story and map a life all over again from the start, the many forking paths on a quest, the caprice of the dice rolls that decide your fate.

Something about all of that, and my own memories of D&D as a child. 

Something deeply moving about the power of charting your own character and adventure. How it can lift up even those who have nothing at all. 

There is magic in building worlds and fighting monsters with your party. I have felt that magic at a primal level within my being, and to know that it has brought hope to men on death row is one of those moments when you feel your eyes and your heart opened to how much common humanity we have.
