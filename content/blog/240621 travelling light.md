I don’t check in luggage for travel unless absolutely forced to (carrying liquid items for friends, usually), whether the trip is three days or two weeks long, to a warm or wintry place, so I get a lot of questions about how to travel light. Here are all the answers I have.

Honestly, I think the first and most important thing is that you have to **figure out your non-negotiables**. Everyone travels differently, and what you consider essential is very personal. If you are someone who needs more toiletries than can fit into your carry-on clear bag, needs to bring three pairs of shoes, or needs to buy a high volume of souvenirs, then you gotta either abandon the carry-on dream or make some compromises. This is not a judgement against anyone with seemingly non-essential sticking points. I for one am famously fussy about my hairdryer. I hate almost every hotel hairdryer I’ve ever encountered, so I will pack mine. That takes up a lot of space in my luggage, but it is a non-negotiable to *me*.

I also need to caveat that I don’t usually require specialised gear on my holidays. I don’t hike up snowy mountains, scuba dive, or attend very fancy black-tie events. I am also a single person with no kids. There are a lot of factors that enable me to pack light. If this is not you and you can’t, that’s fine too.

With that out of the way, here are my packing principles for a typical trip:
- **Only pack solid-coloured tops and bottoms that all match.** I have an extremely drab wardrobe when I travel because I only pack in shades of grey, black and off-white. But every top and bottom matches. I never have to think about my outfit.
- **Clothing formula: no. of days of trip divided by 2 for tops, 3-4 for bottoms.** I will wear every top at least twice and every bottom for up to 3 days—4 if I’m in a cold country and not sweating. Also include your plane clothes in this count.
- **Packing cubes are your friend.** You don’t even need to get the vacuum pack kind. Just normal ones really help to compress your pile of clothes.
- **One pair of shoes. Which you’ll wear on the plane.** Shoes are a huge waste of luggage space. Get one pair of sensible, nice-looking covered shoes and they will work for anything. I wore the same shoes hiking around a national park in Finland for 7 hours and to the theatre in London.
- **Bar soap.** I am a big fan of multipurpose bar soap. It doesn’t need to be packed in your 100ml liquid toiletries bag, and can be used to wash your body, your face (make sure your soap is marked safe for face), and your clothes if needed.
	- I use the same bar soap for face/body so I don’t bring a separate liquid cleanser anymore when travelling, but I recognise facial skincare is very individual and this might not work for you.
	- I also use solid shampoo, which saves even more space in the toiletries bag.
- **Do not skimp on sunscreen and moisturiser.** These are the only two absolute non-negotiable liquids I will always pack. I also usually pack toner and hand cream, but I would leave them out in a pinch (moisturiser can double up for your hands).
- **Prefer many compact layers over one big coat.** My Uniqlo Ultra Light Down parka is the warmest outerwear I own and it rolls up really small. If I’m in a cold place, I wear multiple layers under it comprising one thicker jacket, cardigans, t-shirts etc. Cardigans are very light and compact to pack if you need to bring two. So is a scarf.
- **Be realistic about your leisure time.** I used to pack my Switch on every holiday until I realised that honestly I never had time to play it. When you’re out sightseeing all day and get back at night, you don’t have energy. So don’t overdo it packing books, games, etc. that you won’t get round to. These days I only bring my Kobo and my iPad and I still don’t have time to use them as much as I want to.

I usually manage to fit all my clothes in one half of my carry-on suitcase, my hairdryer, umbrella and bar soap in the other half, and that’s it. Plenty of space left to bring back souvenirs. My outerwear is all in my backpack so it doesn’t eat luggage space (I find planes so cold I’m usually wearing my cardigan and a jacket on the plane anyway). So are my iPad, Kobo, chargers, water bottle, other small essentials. I don’t carry much else while travelling.

I have a master packing list that I use for every trip, but since as mentioned everyone’s needs are very personal, I don’t think copying my list exactly is of much use. I do think it is *very* useful to make your own master packing list, save it somewhere, and reuse it every time you travel.

Happy flying light! Once you know the liberating feeling of walking right off the plane and through customs without waiting for your luggage, you’ll never want to check in a bag again.
