1. This week I’ve been thinking about managing energy rather than managing time, because having time doesn’t mean much if you don’t have energy to do things during that time. Ideally, I think you want to always be engaged in an activity appropriate to your energy level, and if your energy level is consistently too low to do the things you want to do, then you either have to let them go or take a look at what is expending your energy and manage *those* things accordingly.
2. I have a loose theory that most of us (myself included) are not accustomed to thinking of tasks in terms of how much energy they will take rather than time, which makes energy management unexpectedly challenging.
3. Related to the above, I think there is some unlearning to be done when it comes to how we think about time as a resource to be saved or spent, when really it is just going to flow on regardless of what we do.
4. In the wake of Nintendo’s nuking of Yuzu: I appreciated [this piece][1] on how emulation doesn’t (just) enable piracy, it also preserves art and culture.
5. Once again related to the above, I’ve also been slowly building up my stash of owned media, either physical (CDs, Blurays) or digital (DRM-free ebooks and music files), and it is really hugely satisfying to not be reliant on streaming services for my stuff.
