## Music
- [Radio Paradise](https://radioparadise.com) has an amazing, eclectic mix of music that never gets old. It’s my default “I want radio but I don’t know what I want to listen to” channel.
- [NTS Live](https://www.nts.live/) has a fantastic variety of radio shows in different genres curated by guest DJs.
- I’ve been listening to [SomaFM](https://somafm.com/) since I was in school when Groove Salad got me through many late night essay-writing sessions. A timeless classic.
- [Ambient Worlds](https://www.youtube.com/@AmbientWorlds) and [Blue Turtle](https://www.youtube.com/@BlueTurtle) are my favourite YouTube channels for ambient fantasy music.
- [myNoise](https://mynoise.net/) is the best sound generator on the internet and well worth your one-time donation (or recurring, if you can afford it) to unlock all the sounds on the site.

## Useful stuff
- I discovered [Fitness Blender](https://www.fitnessblender.com) early on in the pandemic, spent the next few years hopping around between different online fitness channels, and kept coming back to FB. Now I pretty much only work out with them. They’re the best. No nonsense, no annoying music, encouraging trainers who emphasise listening to your body, and way cheaper than a gym membership.
- [Pikapods](https://www.pikapods.com) hosts a bunch of really cool apps for you for really cheap. You’d usually need your own server and some sysadmin knowledge to run a lot of these, but for as low as $1/month Pikapods gets you up and running.

## Cool stuff
- [Colossal](https://www.thisiscolossal.com/) showcases interesting art from around the world.
- [Reasons to be Cheerful](https://reasonstobecheerful.world/) brings you good news.
- [Culture Study](https://annehelen.substack.com/) explores culture in all its forms through thought-provoking essays and interviews.
- [Tedium](https://tedium.co/) is just chock full of interesting trivia.
- I devour every new [Admiral Cloudberg](https://admiralcloudberg.medium.com/) air crash analysis faster than I read anything else on the internet.
- [The Atavist](https://magazine.atavist.com/) publishes incredibly compelling, thorough longform narrative journalism.
