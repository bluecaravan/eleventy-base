# About
![An illustration of a woman with black hair holding a teacup](/media/cuifen.png)

Hi, I'm Cuifen. I was born and raised in sunny Singapore, went to university in the UK, and worked for a few years all up and down the country in arts venues from York to Stratford-upon-Avon to London. After London I relocated to the other end of the world to spend some time in Australia with my family, and now I'm back in Singapore.

When I'm not at my day job, I'm reading, writing, watching anime and Japanese stage plays, travelling, gaming, tinkering with tech, going on long walks and doing yoga with my friends, spending time with my family, and entertaining my nephews. And of course, drinking coffee.

I love role-playing games, cosy fiction, liminal spaces, and most of all fantastic things.

## writing
One day I'll get organised and properly update my full publication and speaking history here. Till then, here’s some work I’m particularly proud of:

- My short story [“The Funnies”](https://www.artshouselimited.sg/images/events/2021/gpa/2021/short-story/ss-eng-Chen-Cuifen.pdf) won an Honourable Mention at the Golden Point Awards 2021, and was selected for [Best New Singaporean Short Stories Vol 6](https://epigrambookshop.sg/collections/epigram-books/products/the-epigram-books-collection-of-best-new-singaporean-short-stories-volume-six).
- My essay “Jennifer” was published in Fourth Genre (Vol 22 No 1, Spring 2020). It is a paid journal, but here is an [excerpt](https://muse.jhu.edu/article/750656/pdf).
- My short story “Sunshade, Starlight” won the [Literary Taxidermy Short Story Competition 2019](https://literarytaxidermy.com/contests-previous.html). You can read it in the anthology [Pleasure to Burn](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0999446266). This story was a lot of fun to write, and the folks at Literary Taxidermy were kind enough to invite me back as a judge in 2022, which was even more fun.
- My poem [“What My Net Dragged to the Surface”](http://www.coffeehousepoetry.org/poems/troubadour-poetry-prize-2018) won First Prize at the Troubadour International Poetry Prize 2018.

I’m currently working on a novel project, on and off.

But before I am a writer, I am a daughter, a sister, an aunt, a friend, and a human being. I hope I never stop being curious about the world. 

You can reach me by email at hello at chencuifen dot com.

## things I’m good at, if you’d like to work with me
- Writing, in general. I write press releases, speeches, articles and publicity material for my day job.
- Copyediting. If you have a bunch of disorganised information that you want to make a brochure or website out of, I can organise and clean up your text for you.
- Proofreading.
- Research.
