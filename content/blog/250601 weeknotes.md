I didn’t feel like I have anything much to report this week, but I do want to make a habit of blogging more regularly even if I feel I have nothing to say, so here I am with my text file on a Sunday night wondering if I can make this a weekly ritual. And like magic, now that I’m typing, I find that I have things to say after all (it’s not magic, I’ve spent enough time with writing to know what it is, it’s that thing where just showing up for your words somehow turns a tap on that you didn’t know was even there).

This week was actually hectic for me. I met up with some ex-colleagues for dinner on Monday, and I am constantly grateful for the fact that more than ten years after we stopped working together, we’re still friends. Towards the end of the week, my family was super busy with some house moving shenanigans which left me exhausted even though I all I did was move some of my things from one room to another room and pitch in to help everyone else. My nephews wound up spending all of Saturday at my house with my parents, which shredded my attention into confetti because I simply could not sit down and do anything for long enough to focus before a tiny child came running in to pester me for one thing or another.

On days and weeks like these, when I’m really tired and/or my time and attention are wrested from me for reasons beyond my control, I find it very challenging to make space for creativity. So I end up not writing every day or not writing very much, which fills me with frustration. And this is a cycle that keeps happening (I feel like I have made numerous blog posts about it, and you can be sure I have made even more numerous journal entries about it where I’m going in circles for my eyes only). And, perhaps, this will keep happening until I internalise the lesson the universe is probably trying to teach me, about accepting that I am not defined by my productivity, that I can only do what I’m able to, that, in this season of my life, I am not the person I was in my twenties and early thirties, who had a *lot* of pent-up words that had yet to find an outlet and infinitely more energy.

Anyway—for thinking I had nothing to say when I first opened this file, I wound up saying quite a lot, which I guess is telling in and of itself too. There’s always something on my mind, if I pay attention and spend some time sitting with it. And over and over again, this is a gift I can give to myself: the gift of being quiet enough to listen, and give myself the grace to just exist in this space, without judgement.
