Just a really quick and simple website refresh today. I wanted to upgrade to the latest version of 11ty (3.1.0 at time of writing), but encountered problems with my old blog template as it was made for an older version of 11ty, and for the life of me I could not figure out how to resolve the errors that popped up when I ran through the upgrading process.

Happily, the nice thing about 11ty is that it is really easy to simply port all your pages and old entries to a new template since they’re just markdown files, so I decided to start afresh with the nice and simple base blog template. I actually found it difficult to understand when I first started with 11ty, but now that I’ve been here for a while and grown more comfortable with how 11ty works, I felt much more comfortable tinkering with this template and making minor adjustments to my liking.

Yay simplicity!
