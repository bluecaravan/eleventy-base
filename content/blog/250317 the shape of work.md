I don’t like to talk about work here, for a whole boatload of good reasons related and unrelated to the nature of my work, but sometimes you just need to put down in words that today, work was tough. I’ve worked long enough that I know by now this too shall pass, and there will be good days to come, and more tough days. Still, it doesn’t stop the bad feels from—well—*feeling bad*, when it happens.

I find myself thinking a lot lately about work. I guess, more specifically, about paid employment and how I live my life and what it means to sell my time for the rate I am selling it at. Recently I made an offhand remark to someone about how I would quit my job to pursue my passion if I had gone into investment banking as a young adult and made a mountain of money. They then very logically asked me what my passion is, and the truth is, there are lots of things I like to do, but I struggle to think of what I like enough to make a career of it. 

I do know what sort of life I would prefer to lead. One where I have more control over the hours/days/weeks that I work. One where I can work anywhere I like. One where I can work to live and live more than I work. 

Perhaps thinking about what I like enough to make a career of it isn’t the right thought experiment. Perhaps, terrifying as it is, I should be going at it the other way: what if I let go of the idea of having a career at all? Is there some way I can find a way forward financially while not defining myself by my paid employment and devoting myself to actually living life? These are really challenging questions, but I think the fact that I’m asking them means I shouldn’t discount the feelings that are making me ask them in the first place. I don’t have answers at all. I owe it to myself, nonetheless, to keep thinking.
